# chest-xray-classification
This repository includes the source code and a Jupyter notebook used to train multiple classifiers to identify NORMAL vs. PNEUMONIA x-ray images.

Please see the Jupyter notebook for how to use the code, and feel free to run this on your own computer to reproduce this work.

The data can be obtained from the Kaggle competition, see [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
